# ContentManagementSystem
A structured publishing project where editors create news posts and managers approve content. Features role-based permissions (edit/publish/delete), mandatory review workflows ("Pending" â†’ "Published"), and team hierarchy (senior editors oversee juniors). Designed for organizations that need controlled content publishing without technical overhead.
